# Unified Creek AWOS

A comprehensive weather station and dashboard system implemented in Python using Tkinter, Modbus RTU, and multi-threading. Displays real-time environmental data and logs it reliably.

## üåû Features

### Main Components

- **Full-screen Dashboard** built with Tkinter
- Displays Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, UV Index, AQI, Wind Speed/Direction, and Rainfall
- Supports background images and precise widget positioning

### Sensor Integration

- Uses Modbus RTU for sensor communication (Environment, UV, AQI, Wind, Rain)

### Data Management

- Real-time data collection and display
- CSV logging with daily file rotation and 7-day retention
- State indicators with color coding

### Special Features

- Offline sunrise/sunset times from a CSV file
- Coordinate mapping mode for layout debugging
